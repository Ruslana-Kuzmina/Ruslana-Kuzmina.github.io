## Summary

I happy to share that I've started my new career as a QA Engineer. I've successfully
completed long-term courses "Basic knowledge in IT" and "Functional Testing" at EPAM
Training Center for the last year, and other courses that improved my skills in iT.

Now I meet requirements for a Junior QA Engineer and I’m looking for an entry-level
position or an internship on a real-world project.

I'm quite fluent at the following topics:
- Requirements analysis
- Designing test documentation: Checklists, Test Cases, Bug Reports, Test Result
  Reports, etc.
- Software Development Life Cycle, Agile methodology (Scrum, Kanban)
- Functional testing, GUI testing, Localization testing, Mobile testing, API testing
- Working with Version Control System (Git)

My previous work experience during 8 years as accountant in a transport company has
given me a set of useful skills that beneficial for the new role and make me a robust
QA Engineer. I found the following the most valuable:

- Attentiveness to details
- Excellent communication skills (listening, negotiating, summarizing)
- High quality documentation is a key. I'm able to produce it of strictly follow it
- Self-motivated, conflict-free and responsible team-player
- English level: B1+

I have a great desire for solving problems of business, hone my skills and develop
professionally in IT. And will be appreciate any opportunity to get working experience.
